	<p> I am a sophomore here at the University of Georgia.

I am also going to study abroad the summer semester after junior year in Costa Rica.</p>

<p> <br> I chose to major in accounting because in high school, I loved math. My favorite class was math, it just made sense to me. Once I got to college, I took a college math class and didn't do very well in it. But, even when I wasn't doing well in class, I still enjoyed the topics being taught. So I thought, maybe if I incorporated math into my major I would be happier than just a general math degree. This brought me to accounting. I took my first accounting class and knew it was right for me. It was exactly the type of math I enjoyed, it was like a puzzle for me. </p>
<p> I chose to minor in Spanish because I wanted to make the most out of my four years here at college. So I decided to choose something I was also interested and get a minor in it. I had a lot of credits coming into college, as I was in the IB program in high school. This gave me room in my schedule for a minor. The idea of being able to communicate with others in different countries was intriguing. I also knew I was going to study abroad and that if I minored in SPanish it might make my study abroad easier as I would be able to communicate with people and make friends.  </p>
